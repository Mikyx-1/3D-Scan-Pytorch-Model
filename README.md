# 3D-Scan-Pytorch-Model
This model architecture is designed to classified 3D CT Scan of patients. Normal or Abnormal. I had this model tested on a
subset of MosMedData and it got approximately 61% accuracy on the test set. You can use the full version to get a better performance. Furthermore, I built a Pytorch version, which has the same architecture to compare performance between the two frameworks(Because Tensorflow use graph execution so it's marginally faster than pytorch)
